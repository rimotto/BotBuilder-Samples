﻿This sample shows how to integrate LUIS to a bot with ASP.Net Core 2. 

# Running Locally
## Visual Studio
- Navigate to the samples folder (`botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/21.luis-with-appinsights`) and open `BasicBot.csproj` in Visual Studio.
- Run the project (press `F5` key)

## .NET Core CLI
- Install the [.NET Core CLI tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x). 
- Using the command line, navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/21.luis-with-appinsights` folder.
- Type `dotnet run`.

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to `botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/21.luis-with-appinsights`
- Select `luis-with-appinsights.bot`.


# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. In order to install this and other tools, you can read [Installing CLI Tools](../../../Installing_CLI_tools.md).

To clone this bot, run the following commands.
- Login to Azure
```bash
az login
```
- Set your Azure Subscription ID
    - To select your Azure subscription, run:
```bash
az account set --subscription <YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID>
```

- Collect your Luis Authoring Key from the the [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai) by selecting your name in the top right corner. Save this key for the next step.
> **NOTE**: By default your LUIS Applications will be deployed to your free starter endpoint. An Azure LUIS service will be deployed along with your bot but you must manually add and publish to it from the https://www.luis.ai portal and update your key in the .bot file.


```bash
msbot clone services --noDecorate -folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone -name <BOT-NAME> -location <Azure-location> --luisAuthoringKey LUISKEY
```
The `msbot` command performs the initial provisioning of all the Azure services required for this sample.  In addition, it will perform the initial deploy deployment of the code and LUIS models.  However, configuration is required before your bot will run.



- Note the generated secret generated by `msbot` and keep in a safe place.

  - The secret key is used later for `appsettings.json`.
```bash
The secret used to decrypt <BOT-NAME>.bot is:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=
NOTE: This secret is not recoverable and you should store this secret in a secure place according to best security practices.
Your project may be configured to rely on this secret and you should update it as appropriate.
```
-  Inspect Bot configuration file.
   - The `msbot clone` command above generates a bot configuration file.
   - The name of the bot configuration file is <BOT-NAME>.bot, where <BOT-NAME> is the name of your bot used in the `msbot clone` step.
   - The configuration file can be loaded by the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

- Update your `appsettings.json` with your .bot file path and .bot file secret.
   - Update the `botFilePath` with the name of your generated bot configuration file.
   - Update the `botFileSecret` with the secret that the msbot tool generated from step 4 above.

```bash
{
    "botFilePath": "<BOT-NAME>.bot",
    "botFileSecret": "<YOUR BOT SECRET>"
}
```

- Deploy  your Bot
Now that the `appsettings.json` file is configured correctly, publish your bot.
   - **Visual Studio** Right click, and publish.
   - ** CLI** Follow the instructions on creating a publishing profile and publishing [using the command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles?view=aspnetcore-2.1)


## [Alternate to CLI] Set up LUIS via Portal
- Navigate to [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).
   - Click the `Sign in` button.
   - Click on the `Choose File` and select [basic-bot.json](basic-bot.json) from the `botbuilder-samples/csharp_dotnetcore/43.basic-bot-appinsights/CognitiveModels` folder.
- Update [BotConfiguration.bot](BotConfiguration.bot) file with your AppId, SubscriptionKey, Region and Version. 
    You can find this information under "Manage" tab for your LUIS application at [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).
    - The `AppID` can be found in "Application Information"
    - The `SubscriptionKey` can be found in "Keys and Endpoints", under the `Key 1` column
    - The `region` can be found in "Keys and Endpoints", under the `Region` column
- Update [BotConfiguration.bot](BotConfiguration.bot) file with your Authoring Key.  
    You can find this under your user settings at [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai).  Click on your name in the upper right hand corner of the portal, and click on the "Settings" menu option.
    NOTE: Once you publish your app on LUIS portal for the first time, it takes some time for the endpoint to become available, about 5 minutes of wait should be sufficient.
- Update [basic-bot.bot](basic-bot.bot) file to ensure the `Id` property on the `luis` service type is set to `basic-bot-LUIS`.

****************************************************```
5. Inspect Bot configuration file.
- The `msbot clone` command above generates a bot configuration file.
- The name of the bot configuration file is <NAME>.bot, where <NAME> is the name of your bot used in the `msbot clone` step.
- The configuration file can be loaded by the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/botframeworkemulator).

6. Update <YOUR BOT CONFIGURATION> in `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights\Startup.cs'.

```dotnet
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            ...

            var botConfig = BotConfiguration.Load(botFilePath ??  @".\luis-with-appinsights.bot"..);
            ...
```

 7. Update "YOUR_LUIS_SERVICE_NAME" in `botbuilder-samples\samples\csharp_dotnetcore\21.luis-with-appsinsights\LuisBot.cs'.
 ```dotnet
     public class LuisBot : IBot
    {
       ...
        public static readonly string LuisKey = "YOUR_LUIS_SERVICE_NAME";
 ```
 8. Right click on the generated bot configuration file, click "Properties".
  - Ensure "Copy to Output Directory" is set to "Copy always".


 9. Update your `appsettings.json` with your .bot file path and .bot file secret.
- Update the `botFilePath` with the name of your generated bot configuration file.
- Update the `botFileSecret` with the secret that the msbot tool generated from step 5 above.

```bash
{
    "botFilePath": "<YOUR BOT CONFIG>.bot",
    "botFileSecret": "<YOUR BOT SECRET>"
}
```

## Prerequisites
### Set up LUIS
