# Teams Authentication Bot

Bot Framework v4 bot using Teams authentication.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to get started with authentication in a bot for Microsoft Teams.

The focus of this sample is how to use the Bot Framework support for oauth in your bot. Teams behaves slightly differently than other channels in this regard. Specifically an Invoke Activity is sent to the bot rather than the Event Activity used by other channels. _This Invoke Activity must be forwarded to the dialog if the OAuthPrompt is being used._ This is done by subclassing the ActivityHandler and this sample includes a reusable TeamsActivityHandler. This class is a candidate for future inclusion in the Bot Framework SDK.

The sample uses the bot authentication capabilities in [Azure Bot Service](https://docs.botframework.com), providing features to make it easier to develop a bot that authenticates users to various identity providers such as Azure AD (Azure Active Directory), GitHub, Uber, etc. The OAuth token is then used to make basic Microsoft Graph queries.

> IMPORTANT: The manifest file in this app adds "token.botframework.com" to the list of `validDomains`. This must be included in any bot that uses the Bot Framework OAuth flow.

This sample is a Spring Boot app and uses the Azure CLI and azure-webapp Maven plugin to deploy to Azure.

## Prerequisites
- Java 1.8+
- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- An account on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) if you want to deploy to Azure.
- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

- Run ngrok - point to port 3978
- Create [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ you can use this [Bot Framework registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework)  
- Update the `resources/application.properties` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the  `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
- From the root of this project folder:
    - Build the sample using `mvn package`
    - Unless done previously, install the packages in the local cache by using `mvn install`
    - Run it by using `java -jar .\target\bot-teams-auth-sample.jar`

## Interacting with the bot in Teams

> Note this `manifest.json` specified that the bot will be installed in a "personal" scope only. Please refer to Teams documentation for more details.

You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The bot will respond by requesting you to login to AAD, then making a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returning the results.

## Deploy the bot to Azure
As described on [Deploy your bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-deploy-az-cli), you will perform the first 4 steps to setup the Azure app, then deploy the code using the azure-webapp Maven plugin.

### 1. Login to Azure
From a command (or PowerShell) prompt in the root of the bot folder, execute:  
`az login`

### 2. Set the subscription
`az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"`

If you aren't sure which subscription to use for deploying the bot, you can view the list of subscriptions for your account by using `az account list` command.

### 3. Create an App registration
`az ad app create --display-name "<botname>" --password "<appsecret>" --available-to-other-tenants`

Replace `<botname>` and `<appsecret>` with your own values.

`<botname>` is the unique name of your bot.  
`<appsecret>` is a minimum 16 character password for your bot.

Record the `appid` from the returned JSON

### 4. Create the Azure resources
Replace the values for `<appid>`, `<appsecret>`, `<botname>`, and `<groupname>` in the following commands:

#### To a new Resource Group
```
az deployment sub create --name "teamsAuthDeploy" --location "westus" --template-file ".\deploymentTemplates\template-with-new-rg.json" --parameters appId="<appid>" appSecret="<appsecret>" botId="<botname>" botSku=S1 newAppServicePlanName="teamsAuthPlan" newWebAppName="teamsAuth" groupLocation="westus" newAppServicePlanLocation="westus"
```

#### To an existing Resource Group
```
az deployment group create --resource-group "<groupname>" --template-file ".\deploymentTemplates\template-with-preexisting-rg.json" --parameters appId="<appid>" appSecret="<appsecret>" botId="<botname>" newWebAppName="teamsAuth" newAppServicePlanName="teamsAuthPlan" appServicePlanLocation="westus" --name "teamsAuth"
```

### 5. Update app id and password
In src/main/resources/application.properties update
- `MicrosoftAppPassword` with the botsecret value
- `MicrosoftAppId` with the appid from the first step

### 6. Deploy the code
- Execute `mvn clean package`
- Execute `mvn azure-webapp:deploy -Dgroupname="<groupname>" -Dbotname="<bot-app-service-name>"`

If the deployment is successful, you will be able to test it via "Test in Web Chat" from the Azure Portal using the "Bot Channel Registration" for the bot.

After the bot is deployed, you only need to execute #6 if you make changes to the bot.
